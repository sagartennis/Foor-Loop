# Foor-Loop

A For loop is very similar to a While loop in terms of the action call it provides. A For loop is also used to iterate a statement several times in the program.  In the For loop, just like the While loop, the user decides how many times does the statement repeats itself.

##PROBLEM## 

Write a code that prints the numbers between 2,000 and 3,000 i.e (2000<=number<3000), which are divisible by 8 but not by 6. (Hint: apply Boolean condition - number%8==0 && number%6!=0)
